# PySetup Installation Utility

PySetup is a setup program for Python scripts.

PySetup works by converting the `.py` script into one binary, containing libraries
(DLLs/Shared Libraries/Python Packages),

## Features

* Extensible via Python scripting, allowing implementation of additional files, custom pages. Themes will be added soon.
* Apps are compiled into a single binary, so PySetup supports systems with or without Python.
   * Windows programs are compiled into `.exe` files. Darwin and Linux kernel programs are
     compiled into a basic binary for the program itself, while the setup tool is compiled into
     an AppImage (`.dmg`, `.deb` and `.rpm` packages can also be built).
* DLLs (Win32 libraries) and shared objects (Unix libraries) are packed automatically. On GNU/Linux, it is enabled
  by default if no X11 server can be found.
* Command-line installer is available to install programs on a server.
* Automatically packs your modules.

## Generation

Download the PySetup Toolkit via one of these methods:

* **GitHub Releases**: GitHub Releases is a GitHub functionallity that offers the ability to package
  software for any operating system. GitHub Releases is the main host for PySetup. It is recommended
  to download PySetup through GitHub Releases.

* **GitHub Actions**: If you would like to test nightly builds of PySetup, download the PySetup toolkit through
  GitHub Actions. Just scroll to "Artifacts" and download the binary for your OS. (For FreeBSD, PySetup works
  through Linux binary support.) When reporting issues, always test on this version.
  
  > **Warning**: You need to be logged into GitHub to download through GitHub Actions.

We are going to create a new project folder, to ensure the current directory is not messed up:

```
mkdir ~/pysetup-example
cd ~/pysetup-example
```

Assume you have a simple `hello.py` script on your system. To create one in BASH, type this command:

```
echo 'print("Hello World from PySetup!")' >> hello.py
```

To create the project configuration file, which is needed to generate an installer program, run this command:

```
$ pysetup ensureconfig
Project configuration has been created.

```

A new file called `pysetup_project.yaml` will be created. It contains metadata for your setup program:

```
# PySetup project configuration file.

# Generated by the PySetup command line tool.

info:
  app_name: My script
  app_version: 1.0
  app_publisher: My Company, Inc.

conditions:
  windows_minver: 10.20h2 # Windows 8.1/Server 2012 to Windows 11/Server 2022
  linux_kernel_minver: 4.0 # Minimum Linux kernel version

appearance:
  theme: pysetup # pysetup or tk. pysetup is the PySetup modern theme while tk is the 10-year-old-looking
                 # theme that comes with Tcl/Tk. Does not take effect in the command-line installer.
```

To test the installer GUI, execute the following command:

```
$ pysetup run
Creating install script...
           --------- PySetup 1.0 ---------
 You are in GUI mode. Only exceptions and logs are printed
 here in the GUI mode.
   
 Use the newly created window to
```

To test the installer CLI, execute the following command:

```
$ pysetup run --cli
[screen clear]
My script Setup                                          Version: 1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Select your language. This language will be used during
the installation.

Use the arrow keys to select an option. Press Enter to start
installing My script.

```

To generate the `hello.py` installer, execute the following command:

```
$ pysetup package

Warning for Mac testing: There is no cheap Mac in Earth. All Macs
cost more than $100/Â£100. Same for MacBooks and most other Apple products.
If you don't have enough money for a Mac or MacBook, you must setup a
Hackintosh, which takes hours to set up and the worst part of it - it's illegal
in a lot of countries.

                  Packaging complete!
